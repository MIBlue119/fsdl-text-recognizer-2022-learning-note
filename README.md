This my learning note about the 2022 Full Stack Deep Learning(FSDL)

## Intro 

[Full Stack Deep Learning](https://fullstackdeeplearning.com/) course was launched from 2019 by UC Berceley's students and some industry people.
- It provides many key requirements to make a ML production FSDL
    - The different between research and production
    - Infrastructure and tooling for deep learning 
    - Data management 
    - Testing and CI for the deep learning producion
    - Deployment and monitoring the deployed dl production
